            <h1>Dating Safety Tips</h1>
            <p style="color:grey">Meeting new people is exciting, but you should always be cautious when interacting with someone you don’t know. Use your best judgment and put your safety first, whether you are exchanging initial messages or meeting in person. While you can’t control the actions of others, there are things you can do to help you stay safe during your Akadbkad experience.</p>
            <h3>Online Safety</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 18px;">• &nbsp; Never Send Money or Share Financial Information</p>
            <p style="color:grey"> Never send money, especially over wire transfer, even if the person
                claims to be in an emergency. Wiring money is like sending cash — it’s
                nearly impossible to reverse the transaction or trace where the money
                went. Never share information that could be used to access your
                financial accounts. If another user asks you for money, report it to us
                immediately.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px;">• &nbsp;	Protect Your Personal Information</p>
            <p style="color:grey"> Never share personal information, such as your social security number, home or work address, or details about your daily routine 
                (e.g., that you go to a  certain gym every Monday) with people you don’t know. If you are a parent, limit the information that you share about your children on your profile 
                and in early communications. Avoid sharing details such as your children’s names, where they go to school, or their ages or genders.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px;">• &nbsp;	Be Wary of Long Distance and Overseas Relationships</p>
            <p style="color:grey"> Watch out for scammers who claim to be from your country but stuck somewhere else, especially if they ask for financial help to return home. 
                Be wary of anyone who will not meet in person or talk on a phone/video call—they may not be who they say they are. If someone is avoiding your questions or 
                pushing for a serious relationship without meeting or getting to know you first — that’s a red flag.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px;">• &nbsp; Report All Suspicious and Offensive Behavior</p>
            <p style="color:grey"> You know when someone’s crossed the line and when they do, we want to know about it. Block and report anyone that violates our terms. 
                Here are some examples of violations:<br>
                 o &nbsp;	Requests for money or donations<br>
                 o &nbsp;	Underage users<br>
                 o &nbsp;	Harassment, threats, and offensive messages<br>
                 o &nbsp;	Inappropriate or harmful behavior during or after meeting in person<br>
                 o &nbsp;	Fraudulent profiles<br>
                 o &nbsp;	Spam or solicitation including links to commercial websites or attempts to sell products or services
            </p>
